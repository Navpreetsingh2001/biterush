# **App Name**: Campus Grub

## Core Features:

- Block and Food Court Display: Display university blocks/locations. On selecting a block, show the available food courts within that block.
- Menu and Ordering: Show the menu for the selected food court. Implement basic food ordering functionality.
- GPay QR Code Payment: Integrate a QR code display for the total price, which links to a GPay scanner for payment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use the university's official color, or a modern neutral shade (e.g., light gray or beige) for the background.
- Secondary color: Complementary color to the primary, used for headers and key elements (e.g., a shade of blue or green).
- Accent: A bright, contrasting color like orange or teal to highlight interactive elements (buttons, links).
- Use a card-based layout for displaying food courts and menu items.
- Ensure a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and phones).
- Use recognizable and consistent icons for food categories (e.g., burger, pizza, salad) and UI elements (e.g., cart, location).
